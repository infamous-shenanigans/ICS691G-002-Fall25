#### The Paper
This paper strives to answer the question of whether they can reliably predict suicide attempts in youths within 3 months of an attempt with a computerized adaptive screening. This paper goes on to describe their methods for collecting data from surveys issued during emergency room visits for suicide attempts. It also lists multiple psychological screening tests used in creating an adaptive screening computer application. The paper then goes on to explain how it achieved an 80% in study one and 83% in study two, detecting a second attempt or no attempt within three months. 

I chose this paper due to it being similar to a research project I am currently working on. Though our project is not to predict a second suicide attempt after an emergency room visit for a suicide attempt, but to predict suicidality during group talk therapy.
